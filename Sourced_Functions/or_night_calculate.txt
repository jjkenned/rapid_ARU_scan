### Function for converting day-month-year formatted time to ordinal date
# based on Noon split and Jan 1st midnight - noon is night 1. 
# this requires lubridate for yday function

or.night = function(day,month,year,hour,cutoff_hr){
  
  # part 1 makes date into yday
  or_date = yday(as.Date(paste(day,month,year,sep = "-"),format = "%d-%m-%Y"))
  
  if (hour<cutoff_hr){or_night = or_date
  } else {or_night = or_date + 1}
  
  return(or_night)
